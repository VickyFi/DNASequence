Each strand of DNA can be thought of as a sequence of symbols (characters) from alphabet {A, C, G, T}. 
The clones are held together by links between them Supplemental bases: Adenine (A) is complementary to Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C) of Guanine (G). 
For a given DNA strand, the corresponding mRNA strand is identical to the supplement of the given section with the difference that its positions
Thymine (T) is occupied by Uracil (U).

The genetic code is a triplet code. Each triad of mRNA bases that encode an amino acid is called a codon. 
To create the protein (= amino acid sequence) representing a portion of an mRNA molecule is located at the start codon is the "AUG". 
Each base triad is then converted to the corresponding base amino acid the genetic code. 
This process (called translation) ends when it is found termination code. 

The termination codes are three: "UAG", "UGA", "UAA".

The purpose of this work is to manage DNA / mRNA strand segments and inform the user for the existence of codons.
